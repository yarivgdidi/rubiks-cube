A web application that solves the Rubik's cube

This project has been created for my own entertainment.

It is written in plain javascript using three.js as WebGL 3D engine and with a touch of angular-js.

a working demo is available [here](http://rubiks-cube-js.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/) or at [five-software.com/rubiks](http://five-software.com/rubiks/) (my old home page)

a much newer version (demo only) is available at [cubesolver.app](https://cubesolver.app).

To run it locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/yarivgdidi/rubiks-cube.git
npm i -g http-server            // if you don't have one installed yet
npx http-server <path-to-dir>   // e.g. npx http-server c:\five\rubiks-cube
```
Then browse to http://localhost:8080

(No build required, isn't it amazing )

Under docs, you will find a short description of the project (sorry, hebrew only).

Enjoy
